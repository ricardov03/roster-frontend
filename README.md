> **NOTICE:** I started working on this challenge last night. I've been working the whole night to finish the Backend. I was trying to work with the Frontend right away, but I was sitting down the entire night, and I needed to disconnect to eat and attend sensitive diligences that only work during working hours during my visit to the US. I will be finishing the whole Frontend after my return.
